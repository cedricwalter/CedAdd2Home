-The message appears after 2 seconds (customizable) from page load, and is destroyed after 20 seconds (also customizable). The balloon enters and exits the screen with a quick configurable animation: drop from top, bubble from bottom or fade in/out.
-The balloon can be dismissed any time by tapping the small “x” icon.
-The script also checks the user locale and shows the message in an appropriate language. So far the following languages are supported:
Catalan Chinese (Traditional and Simplified) Danish Dutch English Finnish French German Greek Hebrew Hungarian Italian Japanese Korean Norwegian Portuguese Russian Spanish Swedish Thai Turkish
