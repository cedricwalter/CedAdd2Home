PLG_SYSTEM_ADD2HOME_XML_DESCRIPTION="The plugin places a floating balloon inviting the user to add your application to the home screen.\niPhone does not support fixed positioned elements, so the message has to be relocated on each page scroll.The code is compatible with iPhone/iPod touch, iPhone4 and iPad. On older devices the “add” icon is a “+” while\non iOS 4.2 it has been replaced with . The script detects the OS version and displays the appropriate icon.\n\nThe message appears after 2 seconds (customizable) from page load, and is destroyed after 20 seconds (also\ncustomizable). The balloon enters and exits the screen with a quick configurable animation: drop from top,\nbubble from bottom or fade in/out.\n\nThe balloon can be dismissed any time by tapping the small “x” icon.\n\nThe script is compatible with iOS 6+ and Chrome 31+.\n"
